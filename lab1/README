FILE DESCRIPTIONS

lab1_test.c:

	This is the test code for the system call "sys_simple_add" and can be built by running "gcc -o lab1_test lab1_test.c"

	To run the program, pass the two numbers you wish to add as parameters to the executable as such:

	./lab1_test numOne numTwo

	The output of this program is the exit status of the system call, and the result of summing the two numbers using sys_simple_add

	The output of sys_simple_add should immediately be reflected in the syslog file

	This file can be stored in the home directory

Makefile:

	This is the makefile for the x86 system calls.

	This makefile should be stored under arch/x86/kernel in order to add the correct system call object code to the kernel build.

simple_add.c:

	This is the source file for the  system call to add two numbers. It takes two integers and an integer address as parameters. The two integers
	are printed to the syslog, summed, the answer printed to the syslog, and the answer stored in the address.

	This file should be stored under arch/x86/kernel in order to be correctly compiled into the kernel.

syscall_64.tbl:

	This file maintains system call location information for the kernel.

	This file should be stored under arch/x86/syscalls.

syscalls.h:

	This is the header file for using system calls, and maintains information on currently available calls.

	This file should be stored under include/linux.

syslog:

	This file contains system messages and other information concerning operational aspects of applications and the kernel.

	It is normally located under /var/log/syslog.
